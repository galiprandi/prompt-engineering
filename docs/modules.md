# Modules and File Map

Last updated: 2025-09-21 14:15 (commit eabb9a0)

Quick map of important folders and their intent:

- `pages/` — top-level pages used by the static site/presentation.
- `components/` — reusable UI components.
- `assets/` — images and media used by slides and pages.
- `styles/` — CSS/SCSS or styling assets.
- `snippets/` — code snippets referenced in the presentation.

Key files at repository root:

- `README.md` — presentation overview (Spanish).
- `slides.md` — the slide deck content (Markdown).
- `package.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` — Node.js package metadata and lockfile.
