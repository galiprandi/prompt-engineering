Key directories and their roles:

- `pages/` — top-level pages for the site. Look here for routing and content entry points.
- `components/` — UI components used across pages.
- `assets/` — images and static files.
- `styles/` — global styles and CSS resources.
- `snippets/` — reusable content fragments.

How to locate a component:

1. Search `components/` for the component name.
2. Check `pages/` to find where the component is rendered.
