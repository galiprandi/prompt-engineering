Evidence from the repository indicates a JavaScript/TypeScript static site using Node tooling.

- Package manager: `pnpm` (presence of `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- Node dependencies: see `package.json` for exact frameworks and build tools.
- Deployment hints: `netlify.toml` and GitHub Pages link in README.

To inspect exact dependencies run `cat package.json` locally.
