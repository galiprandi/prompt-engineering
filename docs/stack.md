# Stack and Runtime

Last updated: 2025-09-21 14:15 (commit eabb9a0)

This project is a client-side/static site built with Node.js tooling. Evidence in the codebase:

- `package.json` indicates Node.js development dependencies and scripts.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` shows packages installed via `pnpm`.
- Configuration for static hosts: `netlify.toml`, `vercel.json`.

To build or run locally (inferred):

```
# install
pnpm install

# build or serve depending on framework
pnpm run build

pnpm run dev
```

(Check `package.json` for exact scripts.)
