# Technical debt and TODOs

Last updated: 2025-09-21 14:15 (commit eabb9a0)

I searched the codebase for inline `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `XXX` markers. No actionable markers were found in source files besides the lockfile binary data.

If you want a deeper sweep (comments, PR history), run:

```
rg "TODO|FIXME|XXX" -n
```

Add items here as they are discovered.
